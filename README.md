# Fibonacci-Generator

The Fibonacci Sequence Generator is a program designed to compute and display the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. This project aims to create an efficient and user-friendly tool that can generate this sequence for a given input and explore the properties and applications of Fibonacci numbers in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, and nature.

Technical Specifications:

Programming Language: Python
Input: The number of terms to generate in the Fibonacci sequence.
Output: The Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.

Features:

Option to choose between iterative and recursive methods.
Display the sequence in a list format.
Handle large input numbers efficiently.
Optional: Visualization of the sequence growth through graphs or charts.

This description provides a comprehensive overview of the Fibonacci Generator project, covering its purpose, objectives, technical details, and potential applications.
